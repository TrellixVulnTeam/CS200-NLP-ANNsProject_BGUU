Semantically, the aim of the natural sciences is to provide an account of the universe using solely extensional language. A sentence or proposition is said to be extensional if and only if a term in the sentence can be replaced with a co-referential statement without altering the truth value of statement. Thus, the success of the project of the natural sciences is dependent upon existence of a true description of mental states that does not depend upon intentional language; hence, the natural scientist must be committed to either a reductionist or eliminativist thesis with respect to the semantic nature of a true description of mental states. Reductionists claim that intentional language reduces to an equivalent extensional statement, while eliminativists claim that all intensional sentences are false and some extensional statements are true. An eliminativist natural scientist must hold that mental states can be adequately described via extensional language alone or fall in order for her adequately answer the question of how the natural sciences can describe mental states. Thus, eliminativism shall be treated as a subset of reductionism for the purposes of this paper. Having described the semantic commitments of the natural sciences and the potential positions a proponent of the natural sciences might take with respect to the semantic question, we shall now explain why the natural sciences are committed to one of these positions and broader implications of a reductive description of mental states to an account of human life.
