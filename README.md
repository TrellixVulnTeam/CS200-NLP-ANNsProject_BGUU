# CS_JIS_Project


##How to run application (OSX and Mac only)
This application uses a virtualenv isolated python environment. Thus, everything you need to run the application should already be bundled with it. To install the application, simply run "git clone https://github.com/ZachPhillipsGary/CS200-NLP-ANNsProject.git" at your command prompt.
###Preprocessing Stage

3. In a new terminal, cd into the project directory and enter "bin/python corrupt.py" (this will take around 4 hours)
